# Basic_Config
User config files for zsh, bash, vim, tmux, and screen

Contains customizations to bashrc/bash_profile, zshrc, tmux.conf, screenrc, and vimrc and .vim directories.
This is my configuration setup for command completions, display (statuslines, and so on), toys, etc. for these tools

I also recommend getting Powerline fonts, these allow some of the vim customizations to the status line to work properly.
I use Inconsolata, I like the slash in the 0 and general look of this font for most work.
