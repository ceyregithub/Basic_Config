# Basic_Config
User config files for zsh, bash, nvim, tmux, and screen

Contains customizations to bashrc/bash_profile, zshrc, tmux.conf, screenrc, and nvim directories.
This is my configuration setup for command completions, display (statuslines, and so on), toys, etc. for these tools

I also recommend getting Nerd Fonts and/or Powerline fonts, these allow some of the vim customizations to the status line to work properly.
I use Inconsolata, I like the slash in the 0 and general look of this font for most work.
